Risotto
==================================

This the bundle of POCs from the solutions team. In them we simulate the websites of some our customers to show how our payment solutions can integrate better into their scenarios.

### Introduction

#### Motivation
When selling, we need ways to materialize our solutions to prospects. The idea behind this project is to unify them into an stable structure. This will enable us to move faster and concentrate on more value-generating activities.

#### Why the name?
**Risotto** is the one thing bachelors learn to cook - besides ramen - when they get live by themselves. It is a quick and dirty thing, that aggeragates loads of stuff. Just like this project.
